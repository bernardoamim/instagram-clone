# instagram-clone
A clone of a Hashtag page of Instagram using Unsplash API

To do this, first you need to register at Unsplash as a developer. Don't worry, it's simple and easy:

https://unsplash.com/join

Done that already!? Great!!

Now, we'll create a new app at 'Your apps' tab. Accept the terms, give it a cool name and we are done! :)

Then, you can scroll your app's page and you'll find the 'Access key' and the 'Secret key'. 

Great! That's all you need to consume the API. 

As I was making an Instagram clone I used photos that were squarish, but you can use anyone you want!

Here's an example of how I used the 'fetch':

"https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos/?query={SEARCHPARAM}&client_id={YOURACCESSKEY}&page=1&per_page=28&orientation=squarish"
  
I'm not the king of the world! So, if you find a better way to do that, feel free to have fun with it!


Thank you! Any questions, please contact me! Oh, and plz, help me out with a star??

Hugs! :)
